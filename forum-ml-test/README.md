For easy library installation, we can use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

1. Change directory to forum-ml-test
```
cd forum-ml-test
```

2. This step is only required for the first time you try to run this or when you need to update either the `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt`
```
pipenv install
```

3. Enter the virtual environment before you run the application

```
pipenv shell
```

4. Wait to enter the virtual environment and start the application
```
python main.py
```
